### Warning!
Whilst this code is freely available for your use, Centurion is not intended for use outside of the Cent's Lounge Discord server and as such I cannot provide any support should you choose to use code from this project elsewhere. There are multiple features in this code which are half-finished due to the project being abandoned, so I cannot guarantee that this is bug-free. **Use at your own risk.**
